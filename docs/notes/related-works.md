### Road Traffic Noise vs Anomalous Noise Event
Being able to separate Road Traffic Noise from other noise events has been studied,
and methods for this proposed and discussed in:

> ANED algorithm was trained using more than 150 h of expert-manually labeled data,
> coming from the 24 sensors, deployed by the DYNAMAP project in Milan, with around 8% of anomalous noise events
> (e.g., bird singing, sirens, dogs barking, horns, trams)

Development and validation of an anomalous noise events detector focused on salient events through an urban and suburban WASN adapted to real-operation

Road Traffic Noise RTN vs Anomalous Noise Event (ANE).

> The algorithm detected — for the events catalogued as high-salience:
> — all of the present airplane noise
> - more than 90% of works, and people talking
> 
> For the mid-high salience
> - more than 84% of airplane noise
> - nearly 80% of works
> - and more than 60% of people talking
