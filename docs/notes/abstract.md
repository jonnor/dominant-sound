## Summarized
Linear, starting with background, building up the case step by step.
A bit boring. Long time until the contribution the paper comes in.

The availability and cost of Noise Monitoring systems that can measure soundlevels
over longer periods of time are decreasing steadily.
Recent research has also shown that it is possible to use Machine Learning 
to automatically classify audio clips and sound events.
However there is still a lack of tools and methodologies that combine the results
of high-resolution soundlevel monitoring with automated classification,
in order to create automated noise monitoring systems that can quantify
how different sound sources contribute to the overall noise impact.

A perfect solution would require being able to separate each source of interest,
which is extremely difficult in the general case.
We observe that noise events are the main phenomena of interest in many noise monitoring scenarios.

And that for noise events, it may be possible to simplify 

We propose a method that 

Evaluated on real-world datasets that are representative of noise monitoring scenarios.

We explore to which degree the dominant sound-source simplification holds in selected noise monitoring scenarios,
and how much of the overall noise 


## Straight

Propose a method to automatically determine the soundlevel contribution of noise events
coming from diffenent noise sources.

Our contribution is 
A) formalization of two Machine Learning tasks designed to consider the soundlevel contribution during classification, 
namely: Dominant Sound Classification and Dominant Sound Event Detection.
B) Exploration to which degree the dominant sound simplification holds in noise monitoring scenarios
C) Demonstration of a complete system to attribute soundlevel contributions to noise sources, and evaluation of its performance

Our aim is to use machine learning to categorize the audio stream,
and to automatically determine the contribution that each class has to the soundlevel.
