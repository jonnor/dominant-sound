#### DCASE2017 - Sound event detection in real life audio
https://dcase.community/challenge2017/task-sound-event-detection-in-real-life-audio
Captured on city streets in Finland. Recordings are 3-5 minutes long.
Labeled with events.
Classes: brakes squeaking, car, children, large vehicle, people speaking, people walking
2 GB total.

Could be used to study how often sounds co-occur?
