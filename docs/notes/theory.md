# Theory

## Single dominant source

Given a mixture of two sound sources, A and B, where A is the louder of the two.
If B is -5dB of A, then B contribution to sum is 1.2 dB
If B is -10dB of A, then B contribution to sum is 0.4 dB
This means that when A is +10 dB of B, its contribution to the sum is neglible.

The sum based on difference in dB level of two sources can be plotted on a curve which illustrates this.

## Thresholds for becoming noticable noise

TITLE 7 NATURAL RESOURCES & ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL DELAWARE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE, 1149 Regulations Governing the Control of Noise. USA

> Intrusive noise means unwanted sound which intrudes over and above the existing noise at a given location.
> The relative intrusiveness of the sound depends upon its
> amplitude, duration, frequency, time of occurrence and tonal or informational content as well as the prevailing ambient noise level.
> A sound pressure level of 3 dB(A) above the ambient level is normally just discernable,
> with levels of 5 dB(A) to 10 dB(A) the lower level region for complaints.

Noise Guide for Local Government Part 2 Noise assessment, Australia

> The NSW Industrial Noise Policy (EPA 2000),
> which is specifically aimed at large and complex industrial activities,
> defines intrusive noise as 5 decibels above the background noise level
> 
> The background level is the LA90 measurement of all noise in the area of the complaint
> without the subject noise operating or affecting the measurement results.
> 
> The Interim Construction Noise Guideline (DECC 2009) notes there may be
> some community reaction to noise from major construction projects where this is more than 10 decibels
> above the background noise level for work during the daytime.
> This recognises that construction noise is generally temporary
> with the community having a slightly higher tolerance for it.

BS4142:2014 states

> The significance of sound of an industrial and/or commercial nature depends
> upon both the margin by which the rating level of the specific sound source exceeds the background
> sound level and the context in which the sound occurs
> ...
> A difference of around +10dB or more is likely to be an indication of a significant adverse impact,
depending on the context.”
> A difference of around +5dB is likely to be an indication of an adverse impact,
depending on the context.”
